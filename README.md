# SE-SEM---4-DSAL-Assignments

1. Beginning with an empty binary search tree. Construct the binary search tree by
inserting the values in given order. After constructing binary search tree perform
following operations 1) Insert a new node 2) Find numbers of node in longest
path 3) Minimum and maximum data value found in tree 4) Change a tree so that
the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node 5)Search an
element.

2. Beginning with an empty binary tree, Construct binary tree by inserting the values
in the order given. After constructing a binary tree perform following operations
on it-
 Perform inorder, preorder and post order traversal
 Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at
every node
 Find the height of tree
 Copy this tree to another [operator=]
 Count number of leaves, number of internal nodes.
 Erase all nodes in a binary tree.
(Implement both recursive and non-recursive methods)

3. Create an inordered threaded binary search tree. Perform inorder, preorder
traversals without recursion and deletion of a node. Analyze time and space
complexity of the algorithm.

4. Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table
implementation to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two
collision handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons
required to find a set of telephone numbers (Note: Use linear probing with
replacement and without replacement)

5. Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using open hashing technique:
separate chaining using linked list
Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be
comparable, and Keys must be unique. Standard Operations: Insert(key, value),
Find(key), Delete(key)
